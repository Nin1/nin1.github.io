Hi! I'm James, a game-centric programmer with one degree and 4 years' industry experience in game engines. I graduated from Bournemouth University in 2018 with a first-class honours in Games Programming (BSc), and have since been working at Jagex Games Studios on RuneScape and Old School RuneScape.

Professionally I use C++ and Java on a variety of work from game features to scripting engine to build systems, and I enjoy working collaboratively with different teams to solve problems. As a hobbyist, I like to think outside the box and experiment in Unity using C#. If I come up with something interesting, I'll be sure to write a blog about it here!
