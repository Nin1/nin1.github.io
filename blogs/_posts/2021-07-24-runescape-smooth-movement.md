Back in late 2019 I worked on an improvement to the motion of player characters and NPCs in RuneScape. Players and NPCs in RuneScape are aligned to a grid, and have historically moved in straight lines and at fixed speeds, so there were some literal rough-edges to be smoothed out. I already wrote a blog post about this on the official RuneScape website, so I'll just leave a link to it [here](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=135/dev-blog---movement-in-runescape)!
