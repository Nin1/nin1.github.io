Think of a volume, like a cube, within which the world exists and is visible, but outside which there is nothing. The volume exists as a 3D window into the world, so as it moves around in space different parts of the world are revealed to you. Take this horribly-lit screenshot with some te... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reverse-Engineering an MS-DOS Game</title><link href="https://games-hardy.com//posts/underworld-disassembly/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reverse-Engineering an MS-DOS Game" /><published>2021-08-06T19:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-08-06T19:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://games-hardy.com//posts/underworld-disassembly/</id> <content src="https://games-hardy.com//posts/underworld-disassembly/" /> <author> <name>James Hardy</name> </author> <category term="blogs" /> <category term="Misc" /> <summary> My favourite game of all time is Ultima Underworld, a first-person RPG set inside a massive underground prison known as The Stygian Abyss. It was released in 1992 for MS-DOS, and I remember being captivated watching my dad play it as I was growing up. The atmosphere is eerie and claustrophobic, the characters and lore are engaging, and there’s tons to explore. It was also a great feat of tech... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Porting a 40-Year-Old Board Game to Unity</title><link href="https://games-hardy.com//posts/dark-tower/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Porting a 40-Year-Old Board Game to Unity" /><published>2021-07-25T14:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-07-25T15:47:21+01:00</updated> <id>https://games-hardy.com//posts/dark-tower/</id> <content src="https://games-hardy.com//posts/dark-tower/" /> <author> <name>James Hardy</name> </author> <category term="blogs" /> <category term="Unity" /> <summary> A few years ago I was introduced to the 1981 board game Dark Tower, developed by Milton Bradley, which describes itself as “a fantasy adventure born of electronic wizardry”. In the game, up to four players must traverse around the game board to collect three keys, with which to unlock the namesake Dark Tower in the centre of the game board. Once inside, the brave player and their amassed army... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>RuneScape - Smooth Movement</title><link href="https://games-hardy.com//posts/runescape-smooth-movement/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RuneScape - Smooth Movement" /><published>2021-07-24T13:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-07-24T22:59:16+01:00</updated> <id>https://games-hardy.com//posts/runescape-smooth-movement/</id> <content src="https://games-hardy.com//posts/runescape-smooth-movement/" /> <author> <name>James Hardy</name> </author> <category term="blogs" /> <category term="Blogs" /> <category term="Website" /> <summary> Back in late 2019 I worked on an improvement to the motion of player characters and NPCs in RuneScape. Players and NPCs in RuneScape are aligned to a grid, and have historically moved in straight lines and at fixed speeds, so there were some literal rough-edges to be smoothed out. I already wrote a blog post about this on the official RuneScape website, so I’ll just leave a link to it here! </summary> </entry> <entry><title>RuneScape &amp; Old School RuneScape</title><link href="https://games-hardy.com//posts/runescape/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RuneScape &amp; Old School RuneScape" /><published>2021-07-24T13:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-07-25T13:09:17+01:00</updated> <id>https://games-hardy.com//posts/runescape/</id> <content src="https://games-hardy.com//posts/runescape/" /> <author> <name>James Hardy</name> </author> <category term="Work" /> <category term="RuneScape" /> <summary> Released in 2001, RuneScape has been one of the largest names in the MMORPG space for over 20 years. It sees players travel the medieval fantasy world of Gielinor, completing quests, slaying monsters, and training skills to strengthen their character. It was one of my favourite games growing up, so I’m glad to be a part of its never-ending legacy. In 2013 a separate, older version of the gam... </summary> </entry> </feed>
